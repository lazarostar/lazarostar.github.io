Flappy Algo is a blockchain-integrated version of the famous Flappy Bird Game that operates on the Algorand network. Users are required to connect their wallets, pay for the game, and play in order to have their NFT minted with their score, wallet address, and date. Weekly awards are given based on the scores obtained by users.
