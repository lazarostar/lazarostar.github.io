The MagaLu e-commerce platform caters to domestic customers in Brazil.
As a frontend developer for the project, I was responsible for building reusable components using React/Next.js and integrating Shopify into the frontend. I utilized styled-components for styling, implemented cross-browser compatibility, and achieved high performance.
