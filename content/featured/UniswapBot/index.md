I had the idea to create a trading bot that runs on Uniswap V3 protocol, and I spent a month researching Uniswap V3 protocol and crypto trading to conceptualize the bot. To make it easy to interact with Uniswap V3 protocol smart contracts, I developed a Node.js library using web3.js and ethers.js. I also automated the process of scraping on-chain data for Uniswap V3 protocol from the Polygon network and generating new transactions based on the analysis of the collected data.
